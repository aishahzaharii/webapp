## 1.1 INTRODUCTION

Restaurant Management System is a system that provides service facility to the restaurant. This system will help restaurants to maintain the catalog for the list of food and drinks provided. The service provided by this system are food ordering, table reservation management, customer information management, menu information management and report. 

Most small growing restaurants are currently using the traditional pen and paper methods to take orders. For example, a waiter will take orders from customers and write it on a piece of paper. That order will then be passed to two sections that is the cashier and the kitchen chef. This process itself is time consuming and inefficient. As such, there needs to be an app to ease this process. 

With this system, employees will be able to take orders and the order will be kept automatically to the cashier and kitchen sections. The total payment for the order will be calculated automatically.
